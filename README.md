# SMB Promotional Chatbot

## Introduction

This project is a simple chatbot and tooling for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to send promotional messages and collect statistics on customer interactions. The chatbot follows a predefined flow, allowing SMBs to send coupons to customers and track the effectiveness of their promotions.

## Project Details

- **Estimated Time**: ~4 hours
- **Testing Philosophy**: Testable code with an emphasis on coding decisions.
- **Architecture**: Simple architecture for quick development.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors, including downstream dependencies and timeouts.
- **Strengths**: Showcase your expertise, whether it's in architecture, UX, ML, or other areas.

## Project Flow

### 1. Welcome Message
- The chatbot welcomes the customer with a personalized greeting that includes the customer's name.

### 2. Coupon Message
- Clicking "Yes! Show me coupon" displays the coupon message.
    - Clicking on "Reveal the coupon" acknowledges coupon redemption.
- SMBs can track coupon reveal clicks on the statistics dashboard.

### 3. Thank You Message
- Clicking "No, thanks" sends a thank you message with a customizable image.

### 4. Statistics
- Collect statistics on each button click and customer journey within the flow.
    - E.g., How many customers responded to the first message, saw the second message, or interacted with coupons.
- Visualize collected information for SMBs to analyze.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Webhooks**: Used for communication with messaging platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger API).

## Deployment

1. Deployable on a PaaS provider like Heroku or AWS Lambda (serverless).
2. Can also run on a development machine for testing purposes.
3. Use containers to create deployable images.

## Pair Programming Interview

- During the interview, demonstrate the basic requirements mentioned above.
- Be prepared to discuss architecture choices made while building the bot.

## Documentation

- [Facebook Messenger API Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) can provide inspiration for message structure and interactions.
